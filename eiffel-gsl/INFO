- I won't use INTEGER, but INTEGER_32.

- The existing wrapper for gsl_blocks are not used. I (ramack) guess, they will
be removed in near future

- usage of is_equal for real values is not recommended; we should provide a way
to compare all our objects with respect to a user definable epsilon, s.th. like
is_nearly_equal(other: like Current; epsilon: REAL_64): BOOLEAN.
This sould be used in contracts, (?and is_equal should probably be obsoleted?).
