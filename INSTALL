This small tutorial is to explain to newcomers how to setup their environment
to play with Liberty and, why not, even to contribute?

Liberty currently comes with a patched version of SmartEiffel (using Liberty's
libraries) for bootstrap.

Note that this is a temporary setup, as SmartEiffel will be removed as soon as
Liberty can bootstrap from itself.

The installation procedure is as follows: go to the Liberty directory and type

    ./install.sh

Don't forget to add the Liberty/target/bin directory to your PATH...

and you're done :-)
