This small tutorial is to explain to newcomers how to setup their environment
to play with Liberty and, why not, even to contribute?

Liberty Eiffel is the heir of SmartEiffel. As such, SmartEiffel tools
are integrated and maintained as part of Liberty Eiffel.

Please note that SmartEiffel should not be already installed on your system.
Particularily, any /etc/serc file will prevent you from installing Liberty
correctly.

The installation procedure is as follows: go to the Liberty directory and type

    ./install.sh

Don't forget to add the Liberty/target/bin directory to your PATH...

and you're done :-)
