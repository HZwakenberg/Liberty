This small tutorial is to explain to newcomers how to setup their environment
to play with LibertyEiffel, and, why not, even to contribute?

Liberty currently comes with a patched version of SmartEiffel for bootstrap.
Note that this is a temporary setup, as SmartEiffel will be removed as soon as
Liberty can bootstrap from itself.

The installation procedure is as follows: go to the Liberty directory and type

    ./install.sh

and you're done :-)
