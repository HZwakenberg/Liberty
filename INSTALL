This small tutorial is to explain to newcomers how to setup their environment to
play with LibertyEiffel, and, why not, even to contribute?

================================================================================
I - Install SmartEiffel
================================================================================

I-1) Download latest SVN copy of SmartEiffel

This is quite simple, the only thing you have to do checkout the latest version
from their SVN repository:

  svn checkout svn://scm.gforge.inria.fr/svn/smarteiffel/trunk SmartEiffel

This will create a SmartEiffel directory in your current directory that contains
both sources and test suite.

I-2) Build SmartEiffel

Then, it's still very easy: go into the brand new and fresh "SmartEiffel"
directory, and build the software with make:

  cd SmartEiffel
  make

This will do two things:
 * create a ".serc" directory in your HOME, that contains configuration files
 for SmartEiffel
 * build SmartEiffel compilation suite in "SmartEiffel/bin"

================================================================================
II - Patch SmartEiffel to use Liberty libraries
================================================================================

II-1) Download latest GIT copy of LibertyEiffel

This is also quit simple. LibertyEiffel repository is hosted by Github. So, to
get your own copy, type:

  cd ..
  git clone git://github.com/tybor/Liberty.git

This will create a Liberty directory in your current directory that contains
current state of the developments of LibertyEiffel

II-2) Patching SmartEiffel

Place the Liberty configuration file in the configuration directory of
SmartEiffel:

  cp Liberty/config/liberty.se ${HOME}/.serc

Then edit this file so that the 'sys' and 'path_liberty' variables point
to where you've just download Liberty.
Suppose your home directory is '/home/mine' and that you've download Liberty in
'Dev', then this line should look like this:

sys: /home/mine/Dev/Liberty/sys/

path_liberty: /home/mine/Dev/Liberty/

Be careful! Don't forget the trailing slash or the '/sys/' suffix.

Then, you also have to modify "vanilla.se" file in order to ignore
SmartEiffel libraries in profit of Liberty ones. For this, comment out the 'lib'
variable in 'Loadpath' section of vanilla.se, like this:

...

[Loadpath]
--lib: ${path_lib}loadpath.se

...

Now, also comment out the 'sys' key in the 'General' section of
vanilla.se, to ignore SmartEiffel low-level plugins to replace them by
Liberty's -- like this (for example):

[General]
--sys: /home/cadrian/Desktop/Workspace/Dev/SmartEiffel/se/trunk/sys/

...

================================================================================
III - Build liberty compiler and interpreter
================================================================================

Now the hard part (!) is over. Go into ${path_liberty}src/tools/main and type:

  compile libertyc.ace
  compile libertyi.ace

You're done!

NB: For this command to work, 'compile' path shall be added in your PATH
environment variable, which means the "SmartEiffel/bin" directory.
