Dear Eiffel users, hackers, and believers,

We are happy to announce the birth Liberty Eiffel.

Liberty Eiffel is born from a simple idea: the Open Source and Free
Software community must be given a really free Eiffel compiler, with
the same high quality requirements as SmartEiffel.

In other words, we are designing and developing an Eiffel compiler,
compatible with SmartEiffel, but with very different goals.

Exit the academic goal to produce papers.
Exit the academic need to keep the code in-house.

Liberty is a community-driven project. You are invited to participate
and test your own ideas. It's very easy: the code is shared on github.

Liberty is only beginning. We need you.

Happy hacking,
