1. Where does the name "Liberty" comes from?

As most Eiffel hackers know, Gustave Eiffel (for whom the language is
named), also built the metallic infrastructure of the Liberty Statue.

More trivia:

  Some people may also know that I (Cyril) happen to live very near to
  Belfort, a town renowned for a sculpture of a lion by Auguste
  Bartholdi.  Bartholdi sculpted the metallic sheets that make the
  Liberty Statue such an awesome sight.
