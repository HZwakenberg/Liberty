Liberty Eiffel's licencing scheme is a bit complex.

- The tools are licenced under the GPLv3 [1]. See the COPYING file at
  the root of the project, i.e. in the same directory as this file.

- Each library has its own licence:

  - Kernel libraries are licenced under the MIT-X11 [2] licence.

  - Other "100% Eiffel" libraries are usually licenced under the
    MIT-X11 [2] licence.

  - Wrapper libraries use the same licence as the underlyiong library
