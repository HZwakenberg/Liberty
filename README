Liberty Eiffel
---------------------------
Liberty is a compiler for the Eiffel programming language, a continuation of the SmartEiffel compiler. We want to retain from SmartEiffel its rigour; but not its rigidity. Think of Liberty as SmartEiffel down from its ivory tower.

Liberty is free as in freedom. We want people to contribute to Liberty from the start.

So please, do join us to give Eiffel the leading position it should have won twenty years ago :-)
