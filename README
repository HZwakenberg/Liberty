This project aims to provide Eiffel wrappers of many of the major
libraries used in the Free Software.

It will support the GNU Eiffel compiler SmartEiffel (
http://smarteiffel.loria.fr/ ).

Some of the libraries that shall be wrapped are:
* GTK+ The GIMP Toolkit
* GSL - GNU Scientific Library
* GNU Triangulated Surface Library
* BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra)
* Gnome libraries (Gnome-vfs GConf)
* GNU Transport Layer Security Library could be wrapped
* All the database APIs (Postgresql, MySQL, SQLite, Firebird, GnomeDB, ODBC et cetera).

USAGE:

To use this library you shall add in your SmartEiffel configuration
file, in the [Environment] section an entry like:

eiffel_libraries: /path/to/your/copy/of/eiffel-libraries/

COMMITS POLICY:

1) there is no strict rule... 

2) ideally each commit should provide compilable code and working
   examples.

3) provided examples and classes *can* be unfinished and uncomplete
   *can* contain warnings, empty features and so on. My motto is
   "something is better than nothing"

4) it is nice to tell other developers what are you working on; an
   email on eiffel-libraries-devel@gna.org suffice.

5) I promise I won't track you with a 9-tail cat to bash you if you commit uncompilable code.

6) another motto I use is: "Compiling code is the king. Good design is
   the queen. Amazing performance is their prince... but the kingdom
   can go on for a while with a king alone"

Otherwise.... happy hacking!

VARIOUS NOTES:

Some random notes I almost copied my my previous work in Eiffel
Wrapper Generator GTK2 example.

* It will not strive - at least now - for perfection.

* the sole target of this branch is to provide usable wrappers of a
fundamental - namely GTK+ v.2.x for the GNU Eiffel compiler.

* Conscius compiler-specific code will be avoided as much as
possible... I'm not a zealot. I recognize the value of
interoperability. But I don't have enough time to check the code with
all the possible OS (Linux, Windows)/ Eiffel compiler (GNU, ISE, VE) /
C compiler. I work on Debian Ubuntu with the GNU compiler on x86 and
PowerPc. I value CPU portability more than compiler portability since
my laptop is an Ubuntu iBook G3. As far as I can say using SmartEiffel
with a GCC will produce code that will run on almost every computing
facility produces in the last 20 years.

* Compiler specific code will be used when any other alternative is
awkward, incovenient, inefficient or just clumsy.

Some example: G_LIST and any other generic GLib data structures... ISE
requires "class G_SLIST [ITEM -> G_OBJECT create make_shared end]" and
rejects "class G_SLIST [ITEM -> G_OBJECT]"; GNU compiler rejects the
former and accepts the latter. Alternatives are:

  1) using gepp (Gobo Eiffer PreProcessor) or

  2) using something like a factory. It factories are like the one I
found in feature new_event of class GDK_EVENT_FACTORY (on 2005-06-20),
then I think that the gepp solution is much better.

For now I will work out only the GNU compiler version. Anyone is
warmly welcome to add support for other compilers, expecially Visual
Eiffel.

* Feature specific of a particular compiler's kernel library (for
example ARRAY.to_external) will be used when an attempt to write
compiler-portable code failed. Those features are labelled by an
obsolete clause. Please feel free to fix them.

* GTK+ wrappers classes are built from original GTK+ C
documentation. Every html page text is copied in the corrisponding
Eiffel source code file, entirely commented out, then progressively
Eiffelized from top to bottom. Difficoult features will be sketched
out in comments; callbacks and signals are currently put into TODO
comments. This behaviour is not meant to pile rubbish, but to quickly
know how much work we still have to do. And currently (2005-06-20)
it's quite a lot. Too much to get lost in details that I would like to
have time to fix. Those who have time are welcome to spend it on
letter-case of describing comments of boolean queries or on whenever
there's a space between a function and its open parenthesis. Tell me
I'm too much untidy and wild but I think that this kind of things are
- at least for me - not worth the effort (see (a) below). This also
means that it is a derivative work of GTK+ Documentation; being a
derivative work we must abide GTK+ license which is LGPL.

Now some quotes to set the mood of this project:

(a) `In contrast, one of my favorite mantras is "perfect is the enemy
of good" [1] and the idea is that "good enough" is actually a lot more
flexible than some idealized perfection.'
	Linus Torvald [3]


"Had the first versions of other imperfect specifications such as
TCP/IP waited ten years for those in disagreement to work out their
differences, the Web might still be hiding somewhere in the back of
inventor Tim Berners-Lee's mind" [2]
