* make all deferred classes inheriting from ANY and undefining
   is_equal and copy.

* implement strongly typed version of G_OBJECT property setters and
  getters. Ideally those Eiffels version should not rely on
  g_object_set and g_object_get C functions that hide the GValue
  handling and do many tests and checks that are automatically
  enforced by static typing or that are handled by Eiffel
  preconditions.

* G_VALUE should be expanded and shall 

* Turn G_PARAM_SPEC into a deferred class and provide strongly-typed
heirs, such as G_PARAM_SPEC_BOOLEAN.

* Many GTK classes has many properties with the same name and the same
type. As far as I know an efficient, smart and correct Eiffel
implementation of those should be to create deferred XXX_PROPERTY
classes with xxx and set_xxx features. Ideally those classes could
also use some cached G_PARAM_SPECs objects that could be stored into
GTK singleton as hidden features.
