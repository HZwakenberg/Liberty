Concept: abstract user interface toolkit, with many backends (from
console to web server, planning gui too)

Each widget has an id and coded behaviour.

The actual user interface provides resources in specific files, that
codes the appearance of the widgets according to their id:

 * for the web back-end, html files are interpreted and ids are used to fill forms
 * for the readline back-end, (todo)
 * for the curses back-end, (todo)
 * for the gui backend, (todo)
