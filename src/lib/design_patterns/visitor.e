deferred class VISITOR
	--
	-- The "Acyclic Visitor" design pattern type marker. This class is empty as each "node visitor" must add
	-- its "visit" feature that visits the corresponding node of a Composite (and each node must inherit from
	-- VISITABLE).
	--
	-- For examples, look at the tools/visitor cluster of SmartEiffel.
