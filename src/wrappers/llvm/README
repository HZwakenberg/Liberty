Wrappers for Low Level Virtual Machine (www.llvm.org)

Currently based on the C bindings; wrapping an object oriented infrastructure
throught bindings that are meant to be used in a strictly non-oo language
imposes some compromises, like "exposing" C_ARRAYs. This should be fixed with a
direct interface with C++ after bootstrap or after wrappers-generator tool will
be upgraded to deal with C++.
