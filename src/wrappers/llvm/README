Wrappers for Low Level Virtual Machine (www.llvm.org)

Currently based on the C bindings; wrapping an object oriented infrastructure
throught bindings that are meant to be used in a strictly non-oo language
imposes some compromises, like "exposing" C_ARRAYs. This should be fixed with a
direct interface with C++ after bootstrap or after wrappers-generator tool will
be upgraded to deal with C++.

Currently is creates a new wrapper everytime a new pointer is received from
the C library. This is obviously not efficient and does not allow to have
collections of wrappers of LLVM objects otherwise we will violate several
COLLECTION postcondition like those of put feature. 

Ideally it should be possible to avoid the usage of wrapper objects.
